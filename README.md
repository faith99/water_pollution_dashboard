# The Ripple Effect: Water & Public Health in Nigeria

An interactive Power BI dashboard project that explores the link between **water access, contamination**, and **disease outcomes** across Nigeria's regions.

##  Project Overview

Unsafe water doesn't just affect hydration, it shapes health, infrastructure, and mortality.

This dashboard was created as a personal data analytics project to investigate how **water quality** and **treatment practices** impact **public health metrics** like disease prevalence, infant mortality, and sanitation access.

Using data from water sources, regional demographics, and health reports, the dashboard uncovers **critical patterns and disparities** across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones.

---

## Key Questions Explored

- Which regions carry the **highest disease burden**, and why?
- How do **water treatment practices** vary by source (well, pond, river, etc.)?
- Are **contaminant levels** consistently high across sources?
- How do **sanitation coverage** and **healthcare access** influence public health outcomes?

---

## Key Insights

1. **Central Nigeria bears the heaviest disease burden**, despite only moderate healthcare access—indicating deeper infrastructure challenges.
2. **Average contaminant levels remain high** (above 5ppm) across all water sources, especially lakes and ponds.
3. A large percentage of water is left **untreated**, with "None" being the most common treatment method across rivers, lakes, and wells.
4. Regions like **East and Central** report **low sanitation coverage** despite dense populations.
5. **Infant mortality rates** remain consistently high across all zones, reinforcing the urgency for systemic interventions.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI** – Data modeling, dashboard design, DAX calculations  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning and prep  
- **Canva** – Layout and icon inspiration  
- **Markdown** – Documentation and reporting
